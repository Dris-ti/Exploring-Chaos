# Exploring Chaos
 A visual representation of 4 chaotic attractors.

Chaos theory, a captivating branch of mathematics, explores the intricate and 
unpredictable behavior of dynamic systems. This project, titled "Exploring Chaos," 
combines the elegance of chaos theory with the visual appeal of computer graphics. 
Specifically, the project focuses on simulating four prominent attractors: Bouali attractor, 
Lorenz attractor, Halvorsen attractor, and Chen-Lee attractor.

It was a group project. My three amazing friends, Shusmita Anjum Aziz, Mirza Aysha Rahman Urme, MD. Jahidul Islam, and I, created this project for our Computer Graphics course offered by our university.
